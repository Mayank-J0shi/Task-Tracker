we created our fake backend using the json-server npm package npm i json-server
then we add the script     "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000" to make it run 5000 ports and also created a dp.json file in 
the root directory so now we can go to localhost:5000/tasks ~ tasks in this case (the name of collection as the db.json can contain multiple collections)
